# Js Task Manager
## Add and manager your daily task with the aid of JS Task Manager.

This Task Manager allows you to add and modify your tasks. You can add any number of tasks and delete anyone you don't need again. 

You can mark tasks as done when modifying/updating a task. Their are other options like Pending, Progressing and arbitrary options which you can add as it suites your needs.

As soon as you start adding tasks, you will have at the bottom your tasks statistics.

With a click of a button, you can can wipe all saved, (un)completed tasks together with all the statistics (Be cautious with this button. The action cannot be reversed).

**Note:** JavaScript localStorage is the storage mechanism used.
